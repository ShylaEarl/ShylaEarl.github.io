    <h4>Jewelweed Health & Wellness, May 2018-September 2019</h4>
    <h5>Holistic Health & Wellness Educator/Retail Manager</h5>
    <p>As the manager of this holistic health and wellness apothecary I provided effective leadership and motivation to the staff, assigned responsibilities, resolved interpersonal conflicts, and managed schedules. I was responsible for creating an inclusive, welcoming, and educational environment for our clientele and provided one on one education along with private herbal consultations and large group learning experiences. I also ordered, maintained, and expanded our inventory selection.</p>
    
    <h4>St. Catherine University, September 2017-December 2017</h4>
    <h5>Teaching Assistant</h5>
    <p>In this position I co-created the curriculum for and taught a graduate level course called Plants, Culture, and Healing which highlights ethnobotany and herbalism, focusing on the healing relationships between people and plants. This course explores the epistemology, axiology, and ontology of healing and culture related to plant medicine and honors diverse and multi-cultural ways of knowing and traditional women's wisdom. This position required me to know and use a variety of teaching methodologies and learning technologies, student learning outcomes assessments, and student focused programming.</P>
    
    <h4>St. Catherine Univeristy, December 2015-December 2017</h4>
    <h5>Research Assistant</h5>
    <p>While on this interdisciplinary research team, I navigated multiple literature databases to create a literature review, used software (Qualtrics) to revise a survey, collected and analyzed data, and prepared several manuscripts for publication and results dissemination. I also presented our findings at the International Conference on Communication in Healthcare and Health Literacy Annual Research Conference (ICCH & HARC) in Baltimore, MD in 2017.</p>
    
    <h4>Everyday Miracles, March 2015-March 2017</h4>
    <h5>Program Coordinator</h5>
    <p>This non-profit agency serves diverse, underserved pregnant women and families by providing birth education, support, and resources. As the car seat program coordinator, I was the liaison between many groups of people with multiple needs. I developed and maintained cross-group collaborative working relationships which required effective, inclusive, and respectful communication with diverse and multi-cultural families, professionals, and agencies. I used multiple software products, and managed client records and databases.</p>
  
    <h4>Sustainable Resources Center, September 2012-March 2015</h4>
    <h5>Community Health Worker/Education & Outreach</h5>
    <p>In this non-profit public health setting, I worked with diverse, underserved families providing environmental health promotion education and resources for green, healthy, lead safe homes. I recruited and retained families enrolled in long term federal grant programs and assisted them in navigating the policies and procedures related to the programs. I created inclusive learning environments, coordinated education and outreach events, and worked across agencies to secure resources for the families I worked with.</p>
